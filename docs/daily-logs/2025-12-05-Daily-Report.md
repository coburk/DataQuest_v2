## 📝 NOTES FOR TOMORROW

### Important Reminders
- ✅ Follow established naming conventions (PascalCase-Kebab for files)
- ✅ Use proper file organization (api/, Controllers/, etc.)
- ✅ All tests must pass before committing
- ✅ Document all API endpoints with XML comments
- ✅ Maintain safeguard consistency across all layers

### Key Success Factors
- Real SQL Server integration is working ✅
- All core services are implemented ✅
- MCP infrastructure is in place ✅
- Only API & tests remain

### Potential Issues to Watch
- SqlConnection string configuration (will need appsettings)
- Test database isolation (ensure clean state per test)
- Async/await patterns in tests
- Error handling in API responses

## 🏆 SUMMARY

**Today was HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE:**
- ✅ Database schema complete and tested
- ✅ Core services all implemented with safeguards
- ✅ Real SQL Server integration achieved
- ✅ All MCP components successfully integrated
- ✅ Zero technical debt introduced
- ✅ Clean git history maintained
