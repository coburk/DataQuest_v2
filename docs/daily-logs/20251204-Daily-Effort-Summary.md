## ⚠️ BLOCKERS & ISSUES

### Current Blockers
- **None identified** ✅

### Resolved Issues Today
- **Case Design Appropriateness** → Resolved by focusing on traditional downtown crimes
- **Student-Targeting Concerns** → Resolved by shifting to professional scenarios
- **Generic Campus Context** → Resolved by adding Downtown SLC specifics
- **CTEs/Subqueries in Tiers 4-5** → Addressed by CR003 and verified in case designs

## 🎯 TOMORROW'S PRIORITIES

### High Priority
1. **Database Schema Design for Crime Database**
   - Create tables for incidents, locations, persons, evidence
   - Design relationships for case scenarios
   - Prepare for seed data creation

2. **Implement Seed Data for Case Examples**
   - Create test data for all 10 cases
   - Ensure data matches case scenarios
   - Validate data quality and relationships

3. **Query Tutor Integration Planning**
   - Review Query Tutor specification
   - Plan canonical query definitions for each case
   - Design Socratic progression paths

### Medium Priority
- Create data dictionary specific to crime database schema
- Document query validation approach
- Begin API service layer design for case system

### Low Priority / Nice to Have
- Create administrative scripts for data cleanup
- Document troubleshooting procedures
- Begin UI/UX planning for case selection interface

## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Key Decisions Made Today

1. **Downtown SLC Context for All Cases** ✅
 - Decision: Use real geographic references (South Temple, Main Street, West Temple, etc.)
   - Rationale: Increases relevance for students studying at downtown SLC university
   - Impact: All cases now have local authenticity and student recognition

2. **Professional Crime Scenarios Over Student-Specific** ✅
   - Decision: Focus on traditional downtown business crimes, not student incidents
   - Rationale: More appropriate, respectful to students, and professionally relevant
   - Impact: Cases feel realistic and don't invade student privacy concerns

3. **CS Student Audience Emphasis** ✅
   - Decision: Design cases with CS student knowledge in mind (infrastructure, security, data)
   - Rationale: Makes content relevant to their studies and future careers
   - Impact: Higher engagement potential with target audience

4. **SQL Documents - Minimal Updates Needed** ✅
   - Decision: Audit found CR003 changes don't conflict with existing SQL docs
   - Rationale: Query Tutor and Pipeline docs focus on method, not features
   - Impact: No blocking updates required; can proceed to implementation

### Design Changes
- **Tier System Document:** Version updated to 1.1 with CR003 reference
- **Case Design Approach:** Shifted from generic to geographically specific
- **Crime Focus:** Changed from campus issues to urban/downtown issues

### Architecture Insights
- **Investigation Methodology** remains core regardless of specific SQL features
- **JOIN Mastery progression** (1-2 → 2-3 → 3-4 → 5-6 → 6-8+ tables) is sound for skill building
- **Professional context** (not academic) makes content more engaging for CS students
