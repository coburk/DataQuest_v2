## 🎯 WHEN TO CREATE DAILY REPORTS

### Always Create When:

- ⏳ Specific work sessions (e.g., "Compliance Review Session")
- ⏳ Execution logs (detailed technical work)
- ⏳ Milestone completions
- ⏳ Crisis or blocker resolution

---

## 📁 FILE NAMING CONVENTION

**Format:** `YYYYMMDD-[Type]-[Descriptor].md`

**Types:**
- `Daily-Effort-Summary` - Main daily summary
- `Session-Summary` - Meeting or work session notes
- `Execution-Log` - Detailed technical work log
- `Work-Log` - General work tracking
- `Milestone-Report` - Major milestone completion

**Examples:**
- `20251204-Daily-Effort-Summary.md`
- `20251204-Session-Summary-Compliance-Review.md`
- `20251204-Execution-Log-Tier-System.md`

## 💡 TIPS FOR GOOD DAILY REPORTS

### Do
- ✅ Be specific (name actual files, features, bugs)
- ✅ Track metrics accurately (hours, commits, documents)
- ✅ Note blockers early (don't wait until they're critical)
- ✅ Link to relevant documents (use relative paths)
- ✅ Plan ahead (tomorrow's priorities should be clear)
- ✅ Document decisions (explain the "why")
- ✅ Be honest about progress (over/under estimates help)

### Don't
- ❌ Be vague ("Worked on stuff")
- ❌ Skip metrics (they tell the real story)
- ❌ Hide blockers (address early)
- ❌ Make promises you can't keep (realistic estimates)
- ❌ Blame external factors (focus on what you can control)
- ❌ Forget to commit work to git
- ❌ Let work pile up (document as you go)

---

## 🔄 REVIEW PROCESS

### Before Submitting Report
1. Verify all documents are committed to git
2. Check that file names follow convention
3. Ensure metrics are accurate
4. Review for typos and clarity
5. Cross-reference with git logs
6. Update project status in report

### After Submitting Report
1. Archive in daily-logs folder
2. Share with team (if applicable)
3. Reference in next day's priorities
4. Use for sprint/milestone reviews

## 📚 EXAMPLES

### Good Daily Report
- Clear executive summary
- Specific completed items
- Actual metrics (hours, documents, commits)
- Realistic assessment of progress

- ❌ Typos and unclear writing
