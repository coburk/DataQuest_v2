## 📋 Document Purpose

This document establishes the **official tier system design** for DataQuest: SQL Detective. It serves as the authoritative guideline for all development decisions, case design, agent configuration, and UI implementation across all phases (MVP through Phase 3+).

**This document is binding** for:
- ✅ Phase 1 (MVP) - Foundation

## 🎯 Executive Vision Statement

DataQuest transforms SQL learning from technical skill acquisition into **authentic career progression through data investigation**.

Students don't complete "levels" in a game. They advance through real career roles, progressing from entry-level analyst to executive director through increasingly sophisticated SQL investigations.

This psychological shift from "levels" to "career" is the core design principle that drives student engagement and learning outcomes.

### Agent Configuration Standards

#### Database Agent Tier Awareness

```
RULE: Database Agent must understand student's current tier.

RULE: Adjust explanations by tier:

Junior Data Analyst:
- Explain basics of tables and columns
- Simple, clear language
- Build confidence
- Celebrate small wins

- Discuss strategic implications
- Acknowledge ambiguity
- Professional-level communication
```

#### Query Tutor Agent Tier Awareness

```
RULE: Hints must be tier-appropriate AND fundamentally Socratic.

RULE: Socratic Method Foundation
- ALL tiers START with questions, not answers
- Guide students to discover answers themselves
- Build from what they already know
- Encourage reasoning and critical thinking
- Only escalate to direct answers as last resort

RULE: Hint Escalation by Tier (Socratic First, Always)

JUNIOR DATA ANALYST:
Level 1 (Socratic): "What tables contain the information you're looking for?"
Level 2 (Socratic): "Which columns from those tables would help you find X?"
Level 3 (Socratic): "How would you combine those columns to answer the question?"
Level 4 (Guided): "Try using SELECT with WHERE - what would that look like?"
Level 5 (Partial): "Here's the structure: SELECT [columns] FROM [table] WHERE..."
Level 6 (Answer): "Here's the canonical query: SELECT..."

SENIOR DATA ANALYST:
Level 1 (Socratic): "What does the question really ask you to find?"
Level 2 (Socratic): "Which tables need to be involved to get that information?"
Level 3 (Socratic): "How would you connect those tables together?"
Level 4 (Guided): "A JOIN might help here - which type? Why?"
Level 5 (Partial): "Your structure looks like: SELECT [...] FROM [...] JOIN..."
Level 6 (Answer): "Here's the canonical query: SELECT..."

DATA INSPECTOR:
Level 1 (Socratic): "What inconsistency or pattern are you trying to verify?"
Level 2 (Socratic): "What does quality verification mean in this context?"
Level 3 (Socratic): "Which tables reveal this quality issue?"
Level 4 (Socratic): "How many tables do you need to JOIN to see the pattern?"
Level 5 (Guided): "Consider using GROUP BY or aggregation - what would you count?"
Level 6 (Answer): "Here's the canonical query: SELECT..."

DATA DETECTIVE:
Level 1 (Socratic): "What pattern or signal are you searching for?"
Level 2 (Socratic): "What evidence would prove or disprove your hypothesis?"
Level 3 (Socratic): "Where in the data would you find that evidence?"
Level 4 (Socratic): "How would you isolate signal from noise?"
Level 5 (Guided): "What query structure would reveal this pattern?"
Level 6 (Answer): "Here's the canonical query: SELECT..."

DIRECTOR OF DATA INTEGRITY:
Level 1 (Socratic): "What strategic question are you trying to answer?"
Level 2 (Socratic): "What multiple interpretations of the data exist?"
Level 3 (Socratic): "What evidence supports or contradicts each interpretation?"
Level 4 (Socratic): "How would you structure a query to test each hypothesis?"
Level 5 (Guided): "Consider this query structure for exploration: ..."
Level 6 (Answer): "Here's one possible query: SELECT..." (Acknowledge others exist)
```

**Critical Principle: Socratic Progression**

```
CORE RULE: Query Tutor is Fundamentally Socratic

The Socratic method assumes:
✓ Students have knowledge they haven't yet accessed
✓ Asking questions activates this latent knowledge
✓ Students discover answers through guided reasoning
✓ Deep learning occurs through intellectual struggle
✓ Direct answers prevent learning

Implementation Mandate:
├─ NEVER jump straight to answers
├─ ALWAYS start with questions about what they know
├─ GUIDE them through reasoning steps
├─ Only show queries when student has exhausted reasoning
├─ Make direct answers the LAST resort, not the first

Escalation is Tier-Based, NOT Socratic-Reduction:
├─ Junior Analyst: More scaffolding in questions
├─ Senior Analyst: Fewer scaffolding, more open questions
├─ Data Inspector: Questions assume knowledge, probe reasoning
├─ Data Detective: Questions test strategic thinking
├─ Director: Questions explore multiple valid interpretations

KEY DISTINCTION:
❌ WRONG: Escalate from hard questions → easy questions → answers
✅ RIGHT: Escalate from open questions → guided questions → structured questions → hints → partial answers → full answers

The Socratic method is the FOUNDATION at every tier.
Escalation adds SPECIFICITY, not ABANDONS Socratic method.
```

**Example: Same Question, Different Tier Treatment**

```
STUDENT QUESTION: "How do I find people with suspicious activity?"

JUNIOR DATA ANALYST (Socratic + Scaffolding):
Q1: "What does 'suspicious activity' mean in this case?"
   (Student: Large transactions)
Q2: "Where in the database would large transactions be recorded?"
   (Student: Transaction logs)
Q3: "What makes a transaction 'large'? How would you define it?"
   (Student: Over $10,000)
Q4: "How would you find all transactions over $10,000?"
   (Student: WHERE Amount > 10000)
✓ Student discovered the query through reasoning

SENIOR DATA ANALYST (Socratic, Less Scaffolding):
Q1: "What defines suspicious in this investigation?"
Q2: "How would you filter for that definition?"
Q3: "What query structure matches that logic?"
   (If still stuck, then show partial query)
✓ Student reasoned with less hand-holding

DATA DETECTIVE (Socratic, Strategic):
Q1: "Is 'suspicious' the same as 'guilty'?"
Q2: "What patterns would distinguish signal from noise?"
Q3: "How would your query account for red herrings?"
   (If stuck: "Consider what makes something both suspicious AND relevant")
✓ Student thinks strategically about investigation

DIRECTOR (Socratic, Multi-Interpretation):
Q1: "What are ALL valid interpretations of 'suspicious'?"
Q2: "Which query would test interpretation #1? #2? #3?"
Q3: "How would you present findings to an executive?"
   (If stuck: "What query structures could you use to explore each?")
✓ Student recognizes multiple valid approaches
```
