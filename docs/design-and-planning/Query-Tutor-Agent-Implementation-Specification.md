## 🧠 Socratic Method Implementation

### Core Principle: ALWAYS Start Socratic

**MANDATORY RULE:**
```
Query Tutor MUST NEVER:
❌ Immediately show a canonical query
❌ Jump to hints without questions first
❌ Provide answers to factual questions
❌ Explain solutions students should discover

Query Tutor MUST ALWAYS:
✅ Start with questions probing what student knows
✅ Build from student's existing understanding
✅ Guide toward discovery through reasoning
✅ Escalate scaffolding progressively
✅ Reserve direct answers as LAST resort
```

### Escalation Levels (NOT Abandonment)

**Critical Distinction:**
```
Level increases specificity and scaffolding.
Level does NOT abandon Socratic method.

Example: "What tables?" → "Which columns?" → 
"How combine?" → "TRY: SELECT..." → 
"Structure: SELECT [...] FROM [...]" → 
"Answer: SELECT..."

At EVERY level, start Socratic.
Escalation adds directiveness, not bypasses method.
```

## 📊 Tier-Specific Socratic Patterns

### TIER 1: Junior Data Analyst

#### Context Requirements
```
Student Characteristics:
- No prior SQL knowledge
- Needs high scaffolding
- Benefits from confidence building
- Responds to encouragement

Case Difficulty:
- Simple, single table
- 0 contradictions
- 0 red herrings
- Linear path to answer
```

#### Question Patterns (MANDATORY ORDER)

**Pattern 1: Table Identification**

```
LEVEL 1 (SOCRATIC - OPEN):
Q: "What information are we trying to find?"
   → Student identifies the goal

LEVEL 2 (SOCRATIC - GUIDED):
Q: "Which table(s) contain that information?"
 → Student names the table(s)

LEVEL 3 (SOCRATIC - STRUCTURED):
Q: "If we SELECT all columns FROM [table], 
    would that answer the question?"
   → Student realizes they need WHERE clause

LEVEL 4 (GUIDED - PARTIAL):
"We need to filter using WHERE. 
 What condition would identify [X]?"
   → Student suggests condition

LEVEL 5 (PARTIAL ANSWER):
"Here's the structure:
 SELECT [columns] FROM [table] WHERE..."
   → Student completes or refines

LEVEL 6 (ANSWER - LAST RESORT):
"The answer is: SELECT [columns] 
 FROM [table] WHERE [condition]"
   → Student sees solution
```

**Pattern 2: Column Selection**

```
LEVEL 1 (SOCRATIC):
Q: "Of all the columns available, 
    which ones actually answer the question?"

LEVEL 2 (SOCRATIC - STRUCTURED):
Q: "Do we need the person's address? 
    Their phone number? Their name?"
   → Student thinks through each

LEVEL 3 (GUIDED):
"We need: [Column A], [Column B]. 
 Do we need anything else?"

LEVEL 4 (PARTIAL):
"SELECT [Column A], [Column B] FROM..."

LEVEL 5 (ANSWER):
"SELECT [all columns] FROM..."
```

**Pattern 3: WHERE Clause Construction**

```
LEVEL 1 (SOCRATIC):
Q: "What's special about the records we want?"
   → Student identifies the condition

LEVEL 2 (SOCRATIC - STRUCTURED):
Q: "How would you describe [X] in numbers?"
   → Student provides threshold or value

LEVEL 3 (GUIDED):
"So we need Amount > [value]. 
 What operator would do that?"

LEVEL 4 (PARTIAL):
"WHERE Amount > [value]"

LEVEL 5 (ANSWER):
"WHERE Amount > 10000"
```

#### Response Templates (Junior Analyst)

**Correct Query Response:**
```
TEMPLATE:
"Excellent! You found it! 
 
You identified:
- The right table: [table]
- The important columns: [columns]
- The filter condition: WHERE [condition]

This tells SQL exactly what data to retrieve.

Ready for the next question?"

VARIATION (NEAR-CORRECT):
"Great reasoning! Your query is almost there.

You correctly identified [correct part].
Let's refine [incorrect part]. 
[Question to guide refinement]"
```

**Stuck After Multiple Attempts:**
```
TEMPLATE:
"You're thinking about this the right way, 
and I can see you're trying different approaches.

Let me help guide you. 
[Ask scaffolding question]"

ESCALATION:
Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 → Level 4 → Answer
(Each attempt moves one level)
```

```

#### Question Patterns (MANDATORY ORDER)

**Pattern 1: Multi-Table Investigation**

```
LEVEL 1 (SOCRATIC - OPEN):
Q: "What information do we need, 
  and which tables provide it?"
   → Student maps tables to requirements

LEVEL 2 (SOCRATIC):
Q: "How are these tables related?"
   → Student identifies relationships

LEVEL 3 (SOCRATIC - STRUCTURED):
Q: "Which columns would we use to JOIN them?"
   → Student identifies join keys

LEVEL 4 (GUIDED):
"A JOIN connects tables through shared columns.
 Which columns would you use?"

LEVEL 5 (PARTIAL):
"SELECT [...] FROM [table1] 
 JOIN [table2] ON..."

LEVEL 6 (ANSWER):
"SELECT [...] FROM [table1] 
 JOIN [table2] ON [table1.id] = [table2.id]"
```

**Pattern 2: Handling Contradictions**

```
LEVEL 1 (SOCRATIC):
Q: "Does the data tell a consistent story?"
   → Student looks for inconsistencies

LEVEL 2 (SOCRATIC):
Q: "What contradicts what?"
   → Student identifies the conflict

LEVEL 3 (SOCRATIC - STRUCTURED):
Q: "How would you investigate this contradiction?"
   → Student designs query to reveal it

LEVEL 4 (GUIDED):
"To see both sides of the contradiction,
 you'd need to SELECT [these columns]
 and compare them how?"

LEVEL 5 (PARTIAL):
"SELECT [...] FROM [...] WHERE..."

LEVEL 6 (ANSWER):
Full query with explanation of contradiction
```

#### Response Templates (Senior Analyst)

**Correct Query Response:**
```
TEMPLATE:
"Perfect! You not only got the answer,
 but you also:
 
- Connected the right tables
- Identified [specific insight]
- Resolved the contradiction

This shows solid analytical thinking."

VARIATION (STRATEGIC APPROACH):
"Your approach makes sense. 
 You're investigating [direction].
 
 What does that tell you about [insight]?"
```

**Partially Correct:**
```
TEMPLATE:
"You're on the right track with [correct part].

However, [incorrect part] needs adjustment.
What if you reconsidered [aspect]?"

NO DIRECT ANSWER YET - guide to discovery
```

**Stuck Pattern:**
```
TEMPLATE:
Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 → Level 4 → Answer
(Each attempt moves ONE level)
(Never skip levels, never jump to answer)
```

## 🔄 Hint Escalation Algorithm

### When to Escalate

**TRIGGER CONDITIONS:**

```
Escalate when:
1. Student attempts same approach 3+ times unsuccessfully
2. Student shows confusion (unclear queries, wrong tables)
3. Student asks explicitly for help
4. 10+ minutes without progress
5. Query has fundamental misunderstanding (wrong table)
6. Student has tried 2+ different unsuccessful strategies

DO NOT escalate if:
✗ Student is thinking (silence is OK, 30 seconds is normal)
✗ Student just asked and got Level 1 response
✗ Student is on first attempt
✗ Query is close but not quite right (refine, don't escalate)
```

### Escalation Path (By Tier)

**Junior Data Analyst:**
```
Attempt 1: Q1 (What tables?)
Attempt 2: Q2 (Which columns?)
Attempt 3: Q3 (How combine?)
Attempt 4: Guide (Try SELECT...)
Attempt 5: Partial (Structure shown)
Attempt 6+: Answer (Full query)
```

**Senior Data Analyst:**
```
Attempt 1: Q1 (Open question about strategy)
Attempt 2: Q2 (Structured guidance)
Attempt 3: Q3 (Specific scaffolding)
Attempt 4: Guide (Approach suggestion)
Attempt 5: Partial (Query structure)
Attempt 6+: Answer (Full query)
```

**Data Inspector & Above:**
```
Attempt 1: Q1 (Strategic question)
Attempt 2: Q2 (Deep probe)
Attempt 3: Q3 (Refined scaffolding)
Attempt 4: Guided approach
Attempt 5: Partial patterns
Attempt 6+: Answer with alternatives
```

### Escalation Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```
FUNCTION escalate_hint(student, case, attempts, tier):
    
    current_level = student.hint_escalation_level
  
    IF attempts >= 3 AND current_level < 6:
        new_level = MIN(current_level + 1, 6)
        student.hint_escalation_level = new_level
        
        hint = get_hint_template(tier, case, new_level)
  response = generate_response(hint, tier, student)
        
        RETURN response
    
    ELSE IF attempts >= 6:
        # Force answer (should be rare for Tiers 4-5)
        response = get_canonical_query(case)
     RETURN response + "Here's the solution..."
    
    ELSE:
        # Return current level response
        hint = get_hint_template(tier, case, current_level)
        response = generate_response(hint, tier, student)
        RETURN response
    
END FUNCTION
```

## 🎯 Error Handling Patterns

### Query Analysis Response

```
ERROR PATTERN: Wrong Table Selected

RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
"Interesting choice. Let me ask: 
 does [incorrect table] contain [information needed]?
 
 Let's think about which table would have [specific data]."

ACTION: Ask guiding question, not correction

---

ERROR PATTERN: Wrong Approach (Query Syntax)

RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
"Your logic is right, but the SQL syntax needs adjustment.

You're thinking correctly about [logic].
SQL expresses that as: [syntax explanation]"

ACTION: Affirm reasoning, correct syntax

---

ERROR PATTERN: Logic Error (Wrong Answer)

RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
"Let me trace through your logic:
 You're getting [X records] because [reason].
 
 But the question asks for [Y records].
 How would you adjust your query?"

ACTION: Help trace error source, guide to fix

---

ERROR PATTERN: Fundamental Misunderstanding

RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
"I notice you're approaching this as [wrong angle].

Actually, the case is asking [correct angle].
Let's start by identifying [first step]."

ACTION: Redirect to correct approach, gentle restart
```

---

## 🔐 Safety Guardrails

### Response Validation Checklist

**Before delivering ANY response, verify:**

```
✅ SOCRATIC METHOD CHECK
   - Does response start with question?
   - Is it tier-appropriate scaffolding?
   - Is it at correct escalation level?
   - Could student discover from this?

✅ TIER APPROPRIATENESS CHECK
   - Is complexity level correct for tier?
   - Is guidance level right (too much/too little)?
   - Are assumptions correct for tier knowledge?
   - Does it assume prior tier mastery?

✅ SAFETY CHECK
   - No direct answers (unless Level 6)
   - No spoilers or solutions
   - No dismissive or discouraging language
   - Respectful of student effort

✅ CLARITY CHECK
   - Is question clear and unambiguous?
   - Could student misunderstand intent?
   - Is language appropriate for tier?
   - Is response focused (not scattered)?

✅ PROGRESS CHECK
   - Does this move toward solution?
   - Is it actionable by student?
   - Can student respond productively?
   - Does it advance learning?
```

### Prohibited Responses

```
❌ NEVER respond with:
   - "That's wrong. The answer is..."
   - "You clearly don't understand..."
   - "Just use [command] without explaining why"
   - "SELECT * FROM..."
   - Sarcasm or frustration
   - Comparisons to other students
   - "Try random approaches until it works"
   - Very long, complex explanations

✅ INSTEAD:
   - Ask what student tried and why
   - Guide toward discovery
   - Celebrate near-correct attempts
   - Break down complex into simple steps
   - Be encouraging and supportive
   - Focus on learning, not perfection
```

## 💾 Conversation State Management

### State Tracking

**State Variables to Maintain:**

```
PER-STUDENT-PER-CASE:
├─ hint_escalation_level (1-6)
├─ attempt_count (0, 1, 2, ...)
├─ query_history (array of attempted queries)
├─ feedback_history (array of responses given)
├─ stuck_detection_flag (true/false)
├─ discovery_markers (what student has figured out)
└─ confidence_signal (high/medium/low - inferred)

PER-INTERACTION:
├─ student_query (SQL attempt)
├─ query_error_type (if error)
├─ suggested_direction (what to probe)
├─ escalation_triggered (true/false)
└─ response_template_used (which template)
```

### State Transitions

```
START STATE:
├─ hint_escalation_level = 1 (Socratic question)
├─ attempt_count = 0
└─ stuck_detection_flag = false

AFTER EACH ATTEMPT:
├─ attempt_count += 1
├─ Store query in history
├─ Evaluate correctness
├─ IF correct:
│  └─ Celebrate, suggest next case
├─ IF partially correct:
│  └─ Affirm correct part, guide refinement
├─ IF incorrect:
│  ├─ Check escalation triggers
│  ├─ IF should escalate:
│  │  └─ hint_escalation_level += 1
│  └─ Otherwise:
│   └─ Refine current level response
└─ Generate next response

STUCK DETECTION:
├─ IF attempt_count >= 6 AND still incorrect:
│  ├─ stuck_detection_flag = true
│  ├─ Set hint_escalation_level = 6 (answer coming)
│  └─ Generate final answer with explanation
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Case Context Integration

**Query Tutor receives from Case System:**

```
{
  caseId: "case_001",
  caseName: "The Timeline Discrepancy",
  studentTier: "Senior Data Analyst",
  expectationType: "find contradictions",
  expectedTables: ["Transactions", "Accounts"],
  canonicalQuery: "SELECT...",
  caseContext: {
    narrative: "...",
    evidence: {...},
    storySteps: {...}
  },
  studentState: {
  caseProgress: "step 2 of 4",
    previousQueries: [...],
    timeSoFar: 480,  // seconds
    attemptCount: 3
  }
}
```

**Query Tutor provides to Response System:**

```
{
  responseType: "socratic_question",
  tier: "Senior Data Analyst",
  escalationLevel: 2,
  question: "...",
  hint: "...",
  tone: "encouraging",
  suggestsNext: "...",
  studentState: {
 progression: "discovering contradiction",
    confidenceLevel: "medium"
  }
}
```

### Database Agent Integration

**Query Tutor coordinates with Database Agent:**

```
When student asks about schema:
├─ Query Tutor: "What would [Database Agent] tell you?"
├─ Routes to Database Agent for schema questions
├─ Database Agent explains schema tier-appropriately
└─ Query Tutor: "Now that you understand, 
  what query would you try?"

When Query Tutor needs context:
├─ Asks Database Agent about schema
├─ Gets tier-appropriate explanation
├─ Incorporates into Socratic questions
```

## 🎓 Conclusion

The Query Tutor Agent is the **heart of DataQuest's learning experience**. This specification operationalizes the Socratic method into concrete behavior patterns that guide students from any tier to discover SQL solutions through reasoning, not memorization.

**Key Success Factors:**

1. **NEVER abandon Socratic method** - This is non-negotiable
2. **Tier-appropriate scaffolding** - Not all students need all guidance
3. **Escalation only when needed** - Trust student reasoning first
4. **Safety and encouragement** - Create psychological safety for learning
5. **Clear state management** - Track progress and avoid loops
