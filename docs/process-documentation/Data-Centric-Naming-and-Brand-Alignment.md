**Strength:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

---

#### **Inspector**

```

**Pros:**

- ❌ Doesn't match detective/investigator tone

**Assessment:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Professional but less narrative

---

### Option B: Hybrid ("Data" + Role Titles)

```
Tier 1: Data Analyst (foundational role)
Tier 2: Data Analyst (with specialization)
Tier 3: Data Inspector (quality/thoroughness)

  Case: "Decoding the Pirate's Ledger"
  Narrative: "Inspecting historical records for clues"
  
Tier 5: Chief Data Detective
  Case: "The Grand Treasure Conspiracy"
  Narrative: "Chief Detective coordinating complex investigation"
```

**The "Data" prefix works across themes because:**

- Same SQL skills apply to any investigation type

---

#### Medical/Healthcare Cases (Future)

```
Tier 2: Data Inspector
  Case: "Patient Data Quality Issues"

  Case: "The Outbreak Investigation"
  Narrative: "Data Detective finding disease patterns"
```

**System flexibility:** 
- Title "Data Detective" works perfectly for medical mysteries
