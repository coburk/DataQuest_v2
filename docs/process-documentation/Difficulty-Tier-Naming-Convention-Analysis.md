## Implementation Checklist

### Update Documentation

- [ ] Replace all "Demonstration" with "Apprentice"
- [ ] Replace all "Apprentice" (old) with "Cadet"
- [ ] Replace all "Journeyman" with "Field Analyst"
- [ ] Replace all "Expert" with "Lead Investigator"
- [ ] Replace all "Master" with "Chief Detective"

### Update Database (Phase 2)

Consider adding optional metadata table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[CaseMetadata] (
    [CaseID] INT PRIMARY KEY,
    [Difficulty] VARCHAR(20), -- 'Apprentice', 'Cadet', 'Field Analyst', 'Lead Investigator', 'Chief Detective'
    [RecommendedRole] VARCHAR(20),
  [EstimatedMinutes] INT,
    [CreatedDate] DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    FOREIGN KEY ([CaseID]) REFERENCES [dbo].[Cases]([CaseID])
);
```

### Update UI

**Case Selection Screen:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Your Current Role: Field Analyst   │
├────────────────────────────────────┤
│ FIELD ANALYST CASES (Your Level)   │
│ ✓ The Office Theft Ring  │
│ ✓ The Data Manipulation            │
│ ✓ The Embezzlement Scheme          │
│ ✓ The Communication Breach │
│ ✓ The Identity Fraud   │
│      │
│ ▼ READY FOR NEXT LEVEL?   │
│ Complete all Field Analyst cases   │
│ to advance to Lead Investigator    │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Update Agent Prompts

**Database Agent:**
```
You are explaining schema to a Field Analyst.
Field Analysts are intermediate investigators 
with solid SQL skills but still learning complexity.

Keep explanations clear but not oversimplified.
They understand JOINs and basic aggregation.
```

**Query Tutor Agent:**
```
This is a Lead Investigator case.
Lead Investigators handle complex scenarios with 
multiple red herrings and cascading contradictions.

Provide hints that guide sophisticated thinking,
not just SQL syntax.
```

---

## Final Recommendation

### Your Proposal: APPROVED ✅

**Your naming scheme is excellent:**

```
Apprentice → Cadet → Field Analyst → Lead Investigator → Chief Detective
```

**Why I recommend it:**

1. ✅ **Clear progression** - Each title is clearly "higher"
2. ✅ **Role-based identity** - Students feel like professionals
3. ✅ **Narrative coherence** - Investigative hierarchy makes sense
4. ✅ **College appeal** - Career advancement appeals to students
5. ✅ **UI-friendly** - Works in every interface
6. ✅ **Sustainability** - System doesn't feel arbitrary
7. ✅ **Engagement** - Students are motivated by "promotion"
8. ✅ **Professional feel** - Still serious about SQL learning

**Implementation:**
- Use your names exactly as proposed
- No schema changes needed
- Update documentation in Phase 2
- Roll out with case library expansion

---

## Conclusion

Your intuition was spot-on. The shift from generic difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) to **role-based investigative progression** (Apprentice → Chief Detective) transforms the system from "educational tool" to "professional development experience."

This makes students feel like they're progressing through a real career path, not just completing difficulty levels.

**Your names are perfect. Proceed with your proposal as-is.**
