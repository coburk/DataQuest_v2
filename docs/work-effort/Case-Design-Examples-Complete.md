## 🎯 WHAT WAS CREATED

### Complete Case Examples for All 5 Tiers

**Tier 1: Junior Data Analyst - "Campus Safety 101"**
- Case 1.1: Missing Report (5-7 minutes)
  - SQL: Simple SELECT, WHERE, COUNT
  - Story: Find missing incident report
  - Engagement: Relevant (campus safety)
  
- Case 1.2: Late Night Activity (3-7 minutes)
  - SQL: SELECT, WHERE with time filter, ORDER BY
  - Story: Identify late-night crime patterns for patrol planning
  - Engagement: Student safety concern

**Tier 2: Senior Data Analyst - "Who's Reporting Crimes?"**
- Case 2.1: Witness Investigation (10-15 minutes)
  - SQL: 2 table JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT
  - Story: Investigate witness reliability pattern
  - Red Herring: Night shift guard reports more (that's their job!)
  - Engagement: Data logic puzzle
  
- Case 2.2: Crime Hotspots (10-15 minutes)
  - SQL: GROUP BY location, COUNT, JOINs, TOP 5
  - Story: Identify where to install campus safety lights
  - Engagement: Real-world resource allocation

**Tier 3: Data Inspector - "The Suspicious Pattern"**
- Case 3.1: Incident Inconsistencies (20-30 minutes)
  - SQL: 3-4 JOINs, NULL handling, CASE statements, GROUP BY
  - Story: Quality check on dispatcher's work
  - Contradiction: Seems like poor work, but actually under-trained on night shift
  - Engagement: Data detective work
  
- Case 3.2: Victim Investigation Chain (20-30 minutes)
  - SQL: Multiple JOINs, temporal analysis, GROUP BY
  - Story: Is victim being targeted or is it data error?
  - Red Herrings: Roommate conflict vs. targeting
  - Engagement: Solving mystery through data

**Tier 4: Data Detective - "The Campus Crime Conspiracy"**
- Case 4.1: Coordinated Theft Ring? (35-50 minutes)
  - SQL: 5-6 complex JOINs, CASE statements, temporal analysis
  - Story: Investigate whether thefts are coordinated
  - Multiple Contradictions:
    - Alex Martinez looks guilty but has alibi
    - Tyler Johnson implicated but in custody
    - Pattern suggests organized crime but actually security flaw
  - Resolution: All thefts used same easily-bypassed lock model
  - Engagement: Complex investigation with surprising conclusion

**Tier 5: Director of Data Integrity - "The Campus Crime Ecosystem"**
- Case 5.1: Spring Break Pattern Prediction (60-90 minutes)
  - SQL: 8+ table JOINs, window functions, complex CTEs, advanced analysis
  - Story: Forecast spring break crime; recommend resource allocation
  - Multiple Valid Interpretations:
    - Visitors cause crime vs. Under-staffing causes crime vs. Seasonal pattern
    - Environmental factors vs. Behavioral factors
    - Preventive measures have cost vs. benefit trade-offs
  - No Single "Right Answer" - Executive judgment required
  - Engagement: Real executive-level decision making

## 🎯 PEDAGOGICAL ALIGNMENT

### Investigation Methodology ✅

**Core Principle:** Complexity comes from investigation methodology, not SQL syntax

**Each Tier Emphasizes:**
- Tier 1: Data exists and is correct
- Tier 2: Data relates across sources
- Tier 3: Data quality must be verified
- Tier 4: Patterns emerge from careful analysis
- Tier 5: Multiple interpretations possible; judgment required

### Professional Development ✅

**Reflects Real Analyst Career:**
- Start: Simple data verification
- Progress: Learn to combine data sources
- Advance: Recognize and fix quality issues
- Expert: Synthesize complex patterns
- Master: Make decisions with ambiguity

### JOIN Mastery Focus ✅

**Not CTEs, Subqueries, Window Functions (for Tiers 4-5)**

**Instead: Sophisticated Multi-Table Orchestration**
- Tier 4: "Let me orchestrate 5-6 tables to find the truth"
- Tier 5: "Let me work with 8+ tables to understand the full ecosystem"
