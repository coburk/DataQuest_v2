- **Server security** (Case 1.1): CS students understand infrastructure
- **Laptop theft** (Case 2.1): Relevant to their hardware
- **Data quality** (Case 3.1-3.2): Core CS concern
- **Complex patterns** (Case 4.1): Algorithmic thinking
- **Urban analysis** (Case 5.1): Systems thinking, big data concepts

### 4. SQL Progression ✅

**Still Maintains Tier Progression:**
- Tier 1: Simple SELECT with WHERE and date filtering
- Tier 2: 2-3 table JOINs, GROUP BY, basic aggregation
- Tier 3: 3-4 table JOINs, NULL handling, CASE statements
- Tier 4: 5-6 table orchestration, temporal analysis
- Tier 5: 8+ tables, CTEs, window functions, statistical analysis

**Maintains Case Characteristics:**
- Persons: 2-3 → 4-5 → 5-7 → 7-10 → 10-15
- Complexity: ⭐ → ⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Red Herrings: 0 → 1 → 2-3 → 3-6 → 4-8+
