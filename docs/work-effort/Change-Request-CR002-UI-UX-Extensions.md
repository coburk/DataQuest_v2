**Date Identified:** December 3, 2025  
**Severity:** INFORMATIONAL  
**Type:** EXTENSION  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

## DEVIATION IDENTIFIED

**Document:** `docs/design-and-planning/UI-UX-Design-Specification.md`  
**Section:** Screen Designs and Responsive Design Guidelines

**Original Proposal (Scope):**
```
MVP Student Interface (WinForms, desktop-only):
- Home Screen
- Case Selection
- Case Execution
- Query Results
- Case Completion
```

**Current Document (Includes):**
```
✅ MVP Student Interface (desktop) - REQUIRED
⏳ Phase 2 Dashboard (progress tracking) - FUTURE
⏳ Phase 3 Mobile Responsive Design - FUTURE
```

---

## EXTENSION 1: PHASE 2 DASHBOARD UI

**Type:** EXTENSION (adds feature beyond capstone scope)

**What's Added:**
```
Screen 6: Dashboard (Career Progression Display)
- Career tier progression visualization
- Achievement badges display
- Current tier progress tracking
- Recommended next case
- Learning statistics (Phase 3+)
- Status: Phase 2+ (not capstone)
```

**Why It's Added:**
```
- Helps plan Phase 2 implementation
- Supports stretch goal planning
- Useful for system architecture understanding
- Explicitly marked as Phase 2+
```

**Capstone Impact:**
```
❌ NO IMPACT on Week 10 deliverable
- Not required for capstone
- Not developed in Weeks 1-10
- Only documented for planning purposes
- Clearly marked as Phase 2+
```

**Approval:**
```
✅ APPROVED - Good practice to document forward planning
- Adds no scope to MVP
- Clearly demarcated
- Helps with stretch goal planning
- Professional long-term thinking
```

---

## EXTENSION 2: RESPONSIVE DESIGN (PHASE 3+)

**Type:** EXTENSION (adds platform beyond capstone scope)

**What's Added:**
```
Responsive Design Guidelines section:
- Tablet breakpoints (768px - 1199px)
- Mobile layout (< 768px) - Phase 3+ IF SUPPORTED
- Keyboard-aware layout guidance
- Touch interaction guidance
- Adaptation for different screen sizes
- Status: Phase 3+ (future, if pursued)

Note: Proposal specifies "WinForms desktop application"
This is planning for potential future web/mobile expansion
```

**Why It's Added:**
```
- Shows consideration for accessibility
- Plans for potential cross-platform future
- Modern design best practice
- Optional Phase 3+ feature
```

**Capstone Impact:**
```
❌ NO IMPACT on Week 10 deliverable
- WinForms remains primary platform
- Desktop-only for capstone
- Mobile is IF-SUPPORTED future work
- Clearly marked as Phase 3+
```

**Approval:**
```
✅ APPROVED - Supports future expansion planning
- Does not change MVP scope
- Proper forward-thinking design
- Optional Phase 3+ feature only
- Professional standards
```

---

## REDUCTION: INSTRUCTOR INTERFACE

**Type:** REDUCTION (scope narrowed from proposal)

**What's Missing:**
```
Proposal Appendix A shows "Instructor Interface" mockup
Current document focuses only on Student Interface
```

**Why It's Missing:**
```
Instructor interface:
- Is Phase 2+ feature (case authoring)
- Not required for MVP capstone
- Not part of student learning experience
- Would require case creation UI (significant scope)
- Appropriately deferred
```

**Capstone Impact:**
```
❌ NO IMPACT on Week 10 deliverable
- Instructor UI not required for MVP
- Student learning experience complete
- Instructor features Phase 2+ only
- Appropriate prioritization
```

**Approval:**
```
✅ APPROVED - Appropriate scope management
- Instructor UI is Phase 2+ feature
- MVP focused on student learning
- Deferred instructor features tracked
- Proper prioritization for capstone
```

---

## IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**What These Extensions Mean:**

```
CAPSTONE DELIVERABLE (Week 10):
✅ All MVP student interface elements included
✅ No new scope for Weeks 1-10
✅ No timeline changes
✅ All proposal requirements met

FUTURE EXPANSION (Phase 2+):
✅ Dashboard design ready when needed
✅ Responsive patterns defined
✅ Clear roadmap for Phase 2 features
✅ Professional long-term planning

SCOPE MANAGEMENT:
✅ No scope creep in MVP
✅ Clear phase demarcation
✅ Conscious design decisions documented
✅ Future work identified and planned
```

---

## APPROVAL DECISION

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

**Approved By:** Project Lead (via systematic review)  
**Approval Date:** December 3, 2025  
**Condition:** None - extensions are clearly marked Phase 2/3

**Rationale:**
```
This is an example of GOOD documentation practice:
1. MVP is complete and clear (Week 10 focus)
2. Extensions don't affect capstone scope
3. Phase 2/3 features are properly marked
4. Shows forward-thinking design
5. Helps with stretch goal planning
6. Doesn't create technical debt or unclear requirements

This is NOT scope creep because:
- MVP scope is crystal clear
- Extensions are explicitly marked Phase 2/3+
- No development work required for extensions before Week 10
- Extensions support (not hinder) capstone delivery
```

---

## DOCUMENTATION NOTES

**For Project Record:**
```
Extension Type: FORWARD-LOOKING DESIGN
- Dashboard planned for Phase 2 (after capstone)
- Mobile responsiveness planned for Phase 3+ (if pursued)
- Instructor interface planned for Phase 2 (after capstone)
- All clearly marked as future work

Capstone Impact: ZERO
- MVP student interface complete
- Week 10 deliverable unaffected
- Timeline unaffected
- Quality unaffected
```

**For Stretch Goal Planning:**
```
If ahead of schedule after Week 8, these could be considered:
1. Additional investigation cases (Tier 1-2)
2. Achievement mockups and display
3. Simplified progress tracking (Phase 2 foundation)
4. User testing with sample students

Dashboard and mobile would NOT be attempted in capstone
(too much work, post-launch features)
```

---

## NEXT PHASE IMPLICATIONS

**When Moving to Phase 2:**
```
Dashboard documentation ready: YES
- Screen designs in this spec
- User flow documented
- Component structure defined
- Can proceed immediately

Responsive design guidelines ready: YES
- Tablet and mobile considerations noted
- Breakpoint definitions provided
- Interaction patterns documented
```

**Future Spec Work Needed (Phase 2+):**
```
- Detailed database schema for progress tracking
- API specifications for analytics
- Instructor case creation UI
- Mobile-specific component design
```

---

- ✅ Extensions don't affect capstone scope
- ✅ MVP remains clear and achievable
- ✅ Future planning is documented
- ✅ No timeline or quality impact
