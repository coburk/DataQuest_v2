## 🔄 SQL FOCUS PROGRESSION

### Updated Tier Progression

```
TIER 1: Junior Data Analyst
└─ SQL Focus: SELECT, WHERE, basic filtering
   └─ Complexity: ⭐

TIER 2: Senior Data Analyst
└─ SQL Focus: Multi-table JOINs (2-3 tables), multiple conditions, basic aggregation
   └─ Complexity: ⭐⭐

TIER 3: Data Inspector
└─ SQL Focus: Complex multi-table JOINs (3-4 tables), GROUP BY, aggregation, NULL handling
   └─ Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐

TIER 4: Data Detective
└─ SQL Focus: Complex multi-table JOINs (5-6 tables), CASE statements, sophisticated WHERE logic
   └─ Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
   └─ NO CTEs ✅, NO subqueries ✅

TIER 5: Director of Data Integrity
└─ SQL Focus: Expert-level multi-table orchestration (6-8+ tables), sophisticated synthesis, complex patterns
   └─ Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   └─ NO CTEs ✅
```

**Key Feature:** Linear JOIN progression (1-2 → 2-3 → 3-4 → 5-6 → 6-8+ tables)

---

## ✨ BENEFITS OF THESE CHANGES

### 1. Aligned with Investigation Methodology ✅
- Complexity comes from business logic (persons, evidence, relationships)
- NOT from SQL syntax features

### 2. Clearer Learning Progression ✅
- Each tier shows mastery of JOINs at increasing scale
- Natural progression students can understand
- No random new SQL features

### 3. Better Pedagogy ✅
- Students deeply master JOINs
- Focus stays on solving investigations
- Reduced cognitive load

### 4. Professional Alignment ✅
- Reflects how real data professionals develop
- JOINs are core skill mastered first
- CTEs/advanced features learned later naturally

### 5. Scope Appropriateness ✅
- Stays true to investigation-focused learning
- Persons + evidence + relationships = complexity
- SQL complexity scales linearly with business complexity

## 📋 WHAT REMAINS UNCHANGED

### Tier 1-3 (No Changes Needed)
```
TIER 1: Junior Data Analyst ✅ (already appropriate)
TIER 2: Senior Data Analyst ✅ (already appropriate)
TIER 3: Data Inspector ✅ (already appropriate)
```

### Case Characteristics (All Tiers - No Changes Needed)
```
- Persons, Evidence, Relationships ✅ (still scale appropriately)
- Red Herrings ✅ (still increase with tier)
- Contradictions ✅ (still increase with tier)
- Duration ✅ (still increases progressively)
```

### Tier Narrative & Branding
```
- All tier names maintained ✅
- All achievement badges maintained ✅
- Career stage descriptions maintained ✅
- Brand messages unchanged ✅
```

## 🎓 INVESTIGATION COMPLEXITY SCALES APPROPRIATELY

### How Investigation Complexity Increases (Tiers 4→5)

**Without CTEs, complexity increases through:**
```
Persons: 7-10 → 10-15 (increased relationships to track)
Evidence Items: 8-12 → 12-20 (more data correlation needed)
Relationships: 5-8 → 8-12 (more JOIN patterns required)
Contradictions: 3-5 → 4-6 (more ambiguity to handle)
Red Herrings: 3-6 → 4-8+ (more critical thinking needed)
Transaction Logs: 12-20 → 20-30+ (temporal patterns more complex)

Result: MASSIVELY more complex investigation
Using sophisticated JOIN patterns, not new SQL features
```
